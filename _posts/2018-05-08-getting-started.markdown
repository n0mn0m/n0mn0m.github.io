I’ve needed to start this for a while. I think most programmers, sys admins, dbas and others work on projects large and small where we quickly find out how to make x work with y or a produce b. Then we check into source control, walk away and forget until we need to remember a detail 6 weeks later. So that’s what I plan to record here. Little notes and snippets of code, settings, whatever might have been on my mind or come across my keyboard in recent days or weeks. Often times it will have something to do with Python, SQL or clustered systems.

The first few post will be on getting Pelican setup with GitHub Pages and Gandi. After that I’ll probably jump into PySpark, HBase, Python and execution plans. Chances are if databases, Python or distributed systems are involved I’m interested in learning and writing about it. If that sounds interesting definitely keep an eye out for more post here.

A little bit about myself. I am currently a data engineer at Humana writing a lot of Python and SQL mixing software engineering practices with data science projects. Before that I worked at a few different companies focused on the Microsoft Data Stack mixing SQL Server, SSIS, SSAS and C# to build data intensive applications. There’s more information on my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.

That’s all for now. More to come soon.
