A few weeks ago the Z Upper Right Assembly broke on my Mini 2. At first, I wasn’t quite sure what was wrong I only knew that the tool head couldn’t raise on the right-hand side. In an email to Adrian (at Lulzbot) we figured out the part had a hairline crack. In a year without covid I could have gone down to [LVL1](https://www.lvl1.org/) to make a replacement part, but not this year. Luckily Lulzbot was easy to get a print from, and really fast too (kudos to them, and that’s nice to know for the future).

With this being my first repair I was a bit nervous. I had never taken my mini apart or tinkered too much instead opting for that with my prints. The good news is Lulzbot has amazing [documentation](https://ohai.lulzbot.com/) for each printer that make repairs relatively straight forward. Beginning to end taking things apart and getting them back together per the [doc](https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/z-axis-right-assembly-mini2/mini-2/) took me an hour, and then it was go time. My first print was [rocktopus](https://www.lulzbot.com/content/meet-rocktopus) which came out great. Seeing the right-hand axis work as expected was a huge relief, and gives me some confidence that I could do more for in the realm of mods and repairs in the future.

Why does this matter? Because [if you can’t fix it, you don’t own it](https://www.ifixit.com/Manifesto), and I was blown away how easy it was to fix my Lulzbot. On top of that it was fun. Outside of gardening I don’t have the opportunity to just fix stuff with my hands that much, and I miss that. Something to look into this year maybe?
