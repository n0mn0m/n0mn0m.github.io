        <p>I read a lot of books throughout the year, but rarely write anything up after finishing them. While I don’t think I have
enough to say about any one book after my first read, I want to capture a sentence or two about them to look back on,
and to share with others. If I mention a book here that you want to talk about send me
a <a href="mailto:alexander.hagerman@icloud.com">message</a>.</p>
<h3 id="q1-2021-list">Q1 2021 List</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Philosophy of Software Design — a good read that will impact how you think about writing your code. Many of these
  ideas have permeated out into general software culture (I think, maybe I’m in a bubble), but I would recommend this.</li>
<li>Why we make things and why it matters — an interesting read on crafts and why we should embrace them.</li>
<li>Humankind — good, but long at many points</li>
<li>Kubernetes Getting Started — as advertised</li>
<li>The Unix Administrators Handbook — I had a former manager recommend this book to me. I’ve read it through twice now
  and I always learn something new.</li>
<li>Fluent Python 2nd Edition — A really good book on Python exploring areas that are not always tread, and Luciano does a
  great job of answering “why” as he goes.</li>
<li>Django Crash Course — as advertised, a good alternative or secondary first Django tutorial.</li>
<li>A Scoop of Django — A good read. I don’t feel like the answer of why is always explained to the level I would like.
  It’s hit and miss, sometimes it is, sometimes there is a link to a blog that I may get around to reading one day. A
  good book none the less.</li>
<li>How to Invent Everything — probably my favorite book so far this year. This is a lot of fun and I look forward to
  reading it with my daughter one day.</li>
<li>Think Julia — I’ve heard a bit about Julia and decided to check this out. A pretty good book revisiting a lot of
  programming first principles in the context of learning them with Julia.</li>
<li>Math for Programmers — I really enjoyed this. I try to keep math as a regular reading topic, and I like it when math
  is demonstrated via programming.</li>
</ul>
