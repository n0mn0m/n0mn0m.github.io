        <p>If you’ve spent time using Python for ETL processes or working with data pipelines using tools from the Apache ecosystem
then you’ve probably heard about <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">Apache Airflow</a>. In this post I’m going to briefly write
about why I’m using Airflow, show how you can get started with Airflow using docker and I will show how I customized
this setup so that you can do the same. Finally at the end I’ll talk about a couple of issues I ran into getting started
with Airflow and docker.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-apache-airflow">What is Apache Airflow</h3>
<p>From the <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">home page</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
  <strong>Programatically</strong> being a key part so that you can create and orchestrate worflows/data pipelines using the same
  processes and tools that let you create reliable, scaling software.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-airflow">Why Airflow</h3>
<p>I don’t plan to write much on this subject since it’s been covered in depth else where, but at work and often times when
talking about Airflow the question of why Airflow versus X traditional solution where X is something like:</p>
<p>inevitably comes up. The primary reason I prefer a solution like Airflow to more traditional solutions is because my ETL
is code. While there are numerous benefits to ETL as code my talking points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your data pipes/workflows go through the same processes that helps you create better products like TDD</li>
<li>Your ETL development and production can be integrated with your CI/CD process</li>
<li>Better debugging tools</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s not to say the traditional tools don’t have their place, but my experience is that any significantly complex data
pipeline ends up making use of that tools script task (C# for SSIS, Java for Informatica) and now you have an
amalgamation of GUI product and untested, undocumented and non versioned code in production data pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="why-conda">Why conda</h3>
<p>By day I’m a data engineer helping to build platforms, applications and pipelines to enable data scientist. Because of
this conda is a tool I’ve become familiar with and it let’s me work across languages, but easily integrate those various
languages into my Airflow dags.</p>
<p>To get started with Airflow I highly recommend reading <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/index.html">the homepage</a>
and <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> to get an idea of the core concepts and pick up on the
vocabulary used within the framework.</p>
<p>After that there is a great project called <a href="https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow">docker-airflow</a> that you can get
started with. This provides a quick way to get started with Airflow in an environment with sane defaults making use of
Postgres and Redis.</p>
<p>This project provides an example dag and also allows you to load the Airflow example dags via the LOADEX environment
variable. Additionally you might want to open up the Airflow dashboard and checkout the Connections tab where you can
setup things such as SSH an SSH connection to reference in your dags.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-the-setup">Customizing the setup</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow">docker-airflow</a> project is a great start, but it makes assumptions that
may not be true of your environment such as which database you plan to use, use of environment variables, etc.</p>
<p>If all you’re needing to tweak is the behavior of the environment or Airflow your first stop should be airflow.cfg in
the /config directory. This is a centralized location for Airflow settings and is checked after any settings from the
environment are loaded. If you're trying to change settings related to work pools, ssl, kerberos, etc this is probably
the best place to get started.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to change things related to your containers such as when to restart, dependencies, etc then your going
to want to checkout either the LocalExecutor or CeleryExecutor docker-compose files.</p>
<p>Finally you might want to make bigger changes like I did such as using a different database, base docker image etc.
Doing this requires changing quite a few items. The changes I made were:</p>
<ul>
<li>switch to miniconda for my base image to use Intel Dist Python</li>
<li>switch to Microsoft SQL Server for the database</li>
<li>switch the task queue to RabbitMQ</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of this was driven by a desire to experiment and to learn more about tools that I use day to day. Since I work in a
data engineering shop there are packages from conda-forge that I like to use driving the miniconda switch, I've used MS
SQL for the last 8 years professionally and I've been working on scaling with RabbitMQ over the last year.</p>
<p>The switch to miniconda was a one liner in the Dockfile:</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM continuumio/miniconda3Then to use IDP (Intel Distribution of Python) within the container I added this towards the bottom:

RUN conda config --add channels intel\
 &amp;&amp; conda config --add channels conda-forge \
 &amp;&amp; conda install -y -q intelpython3core=2019.1 python=3 \
 &amp;&amp; conda clean --all \And with that I can make use of conda packages alongside traditional Python packages within my Airflow environment.
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Next up I wanted to switch to MSSQL. Doing this was a matter of switching from Postgres in docker-compose and adding the
MSSQL Linux drivers to the base docker-airflow Dockerfile.</p>
<p><strong>docker-compose</strong></p>
<p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">mssql:
 image: microsoft/mssql-server-linux:latest
 environment:
 - ACCEPTEULA=Y
 - SAPASSWORD=YourStrong!Passw0rd
 ports:
 - 1433:1433
 volumes:
 - /var/opt/mssqlYou may or may not want to preserver your database volume so keep that in mind.
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Setting up the MSSQL Linux drivers is fairly straight forward following
the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017">documentation</a>
from Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Dockerfile</strong></p>
<p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">ENV ACCEPTEULA=Y
RUN curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add - \
 &amp;&amp; curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.listRUN apt-get update -yqq \
 &amp;&amp; apt-get install -yqq mssql-tools unixodbc-dev
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>One thing to note if you’re using a Debian based image is that Microsoft has a somewhat obscure dependency on
libssl1.0.0. Without that installed you will get some obscure unixodbc error connecting to MSSQL with sql-alchemy. To
remedy this add the below to your Dockerfile.</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">RUN echo 'export PATH=&quot;$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin&quot;' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashprofile
RUN echo &quot;deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free\
 deb-src http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib non-free\n
 deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free\
 deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main contrib non-free&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jessie.listRUN apt update \
 &amp;&amp; apt install libssl1.0.0
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>Finally setup your connection string either in airflow.cfg or an
Airflow <a href="https://airflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/set-config.html">environment variable</a> . I like to use the
Airflow environment variables and pass them in from a .env file with docker-compose.</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">environment:
 - LOADEX=n
 - FERNETKEY=46BKJoQYlPPOexq0OhDZnIlNepKFf87WFwLbfzqDDho=
 - EXECUTOR=Celery
 - AIRFLOWCELERYBROKERURL=${CELERYRABBITBROKER}
 - AIRFLOWCORESQLALCHEMYCONN=${SQLALCHEMYCONN}
 - AIRFLOWCELERYRESULTBACKEND=${CELERYRESULTSBACKEND}And finally the last big change I implemented was the switch to RabbitMQ instead of Redis. Similar to the MSSQL switch this was just an update to the docker-compose file.

rabbitmq:
 image: rabbitmq:3-management
 hostname: rabbitmq
 environment:
 - RABBITMQERLANGCOOKIE=${RABBITMQERLANGCOOKIE}
 - RABBITMQDEFAULTUSER=${RABBITMQDEFAULTUSER}
 - RABBITMQDEFAULTPASS=${RABBITMQDEFAULTPASS}
 - RABBITMQDEFAULTVHOST=${RABBITMQDEFAULTVHOST}
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>And setting up the right connection string for Celery to talk with rabbitmq. Similar to the MSSQL connection string I
put this in my .env file and reference it in my docker-compose file as seen above.</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">CELERYRABBITBROKER=amqp://user:pass@host:port/
</code></pre>
</p>
<p>One thing to note is anytime you are referencing the host and running with docker-compose you can reference the service
id in this case rabbitmq as the host name.
And with that I have a nice Airflow environment that lets me make use of the database I’m familiar with, a durable queue
and packages across the Python and Data Science ecosystems via conda.</p>
<p>You can find these changes in my fork of the <a href="https://github.com/n0mn0m/airflow-docker">docker-airflow</a> project. I’ve
also opened a <a href="https://github.com/puckel/docker-airflow/issues/289">GitHub issue</a> with the goal of creating some way to
track other community variations of docker-airflow with the hope of helping others discover setups specific to their
need.</p>
<h3 id="issues-so-far">Issues so far</h3>
<p>I’ve been using the setup above for a couple weeks now with pretty good results. I’ve made use of some libraries like
hdfs3 that have their latest releases in conda-forge and my familiarity with MSSQL has saved me some maintenance time.
The experience hasn’t been without it’s issues. The highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://airflow.apache.org/installation.html#extra-packages">Airflow packages</a> may not be what you want. See
  librabbitmq and celery. It's best to manage a requirements.txt or conda.txt with your dependencies still.</li>
<li>Dependency management across multiple dags. In short with a standard setup you need one package version and it needs
  to be installed everywhere. For an interesting approach to this
  read <a href="https://medium.com/bluecore-engineering/were-all-using-airflow-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it-a56f14cb0753">We’re All Using Airflow Wrong and How to Fix It</a></li>
<li>Silent failures. Be aware of all the reasons why a worker may provide exit code 0 especially with docker. This took a
  minute to catch when an NFS mount stopped showing new files being available, but the exit code 0 made things seem ok.
  This isn’t Airflows fault, but just something to keep in mind when using Airflow in an environment with docker and
  remote resources.</li>
</ul>
