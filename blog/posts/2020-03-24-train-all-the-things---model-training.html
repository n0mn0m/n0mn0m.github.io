        <p>Recently I spent some time learning how to generate synthetic voices
using <a href="https://burningdaylight.io/posts/train-all-the-things-data-generation/">espeak</a>. After working with the tools to
aligning with the Tensorflow keyword models expectations I was ready for training, and to see how well the synthetic
data performed. TLDR: not well :)</p>
<p>I started by training using the keywords hi, smalltalk and on. This let me have a known working word while testing two
synthetic words. Although training went well:</p>

<p>Because of the brute force nature that I used to generate audio the synthetic training data isn’t very representative of
real human voices. While the experiment didn’t work out, I do think that generating data this way could be useful with
the right amount of time and research. Instead of scaling parameters in a loop I think researching the characteristic of
various human voices and using those to tune the data generated via espeak could actually work out well. That said it’s
possible the model may pick up on characteristics of the espeak program too. Regardless, voice data that is ready for
training is still a hard problem in need of more open solutions.</p>
<p>Along with the way I scaled the espeak parameters another monkey wrench is that the microspeech model makes use of a CNN
and spectrogram of the input audio instead of full signal processing. This means it’s highly likely the model will work
with voices around the comparison spectrogram well, but not generalize. This makes picking the right spectrogram
relative to the user another key task.</p>
<p>Because of these results and bigger issues I ended up tweaking my approach and
used <a href="https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/voice-assistant/smalltalk/main/main_functions.cc">visual</a> as my wake
word followed by on/off. All of these are available in the TF command words dataset, and visual seems like an ok wake
word when controlling a display. For somebody working on a generic voice assistant you will want to work on audio
segmentation since many datasets are sentences, or consider using something
like <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-skainet">Skainet</a>. All of this was less fun than running my own model from
synthtetic data, but I needed to continue forward. After a final round of training with all three words I followed the
TF <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers?hl=he">docs</a> to represent the model as a C array and then flashed
it onto the board with the rest of the program. Using idf monitor I was able to observe the model working as expected:</p>

I developed some [scripts](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/voice-assistant/train) to run through the full data generation, train and export cycle. Training will need to be done based on the architecture somebody is using, but hopefully it’s useful.
