        <p>I read a lot of books this year, but rarely write anything up after finishing them. While I don’t think I have enough to
say about any one book after my first read, I want to capture a sentence or two about them to look back on, and to share
with others. If I mention a book here that you want to talk about send me
a <a href="mailto:alexander.hagerman@icloud.com">message</a>.</p>
<h3 id="q4-2020-list">Q4 2020 List</h3>
<p><strong>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been really interested in the idea of quality and how we achieve it in what we build. Everybody uses a different
  definition of “good”, and I enjoyed the exploration of the topic in this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blockchain Chicken Farm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having grown up in rural kentucky and working in industrial chicken farming, then pivoting to writing software after
  high school this was a fantastic read. A lot to reflect on, the shared humanity, and the audacity of the software
  industry shined beginning to end.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subprime Attention Crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A good exploration of the dangers in the ad based internet economy. While the ad industry has made a lot of tools
  available to those who couldn’t afford them outright, I think we can do better than the current ad economy. While
  shrinking sectors can hurt, I think we need to be careful not to accidentally lead individuals to believe we need to
  maintain the ad economy at the invasive scale we are at today.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understanding Computation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As advertised. Computational theory using Ruby. I enjoyed the read and will probably revisit Part II sometime. It is a
  big book covering a wide range of topics and I don’t think I internalized Part II enough.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Hardware Hacker</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A collection of articles from “bunnie” relaying his experience and some philosophies while manufacturing in the open.
  The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanzhai">shanzhai</a> has popped up here and in other reading over the last few
  years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Angular Development with Typescript, Second Edition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What it sounds like. Reading this for work, and it was helpful as I got going with Angular.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Programming Typescript</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What it sounds like. A good read after going through the docs at typescriptlang.org.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vader Down</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vader being Vader. Fun short read.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shadowfall</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This popped up as new at the library, and I was a few chapters in when I realized I had missed the first book in a
  series. So far I like it. It’s in the same vein as rogue squadron, and the author is working to write characters in a
  complicated environment. Curious to see how the series wraps up and if the character arcs land.</li>
