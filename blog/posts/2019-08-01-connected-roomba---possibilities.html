        <p>A couple years ago at PyCon I received a kit from Adafruit containing
the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2769">Circuit Playground Express</a>. After going through the Hello World examples I
boxed it up I didnâ€™t have a project ready to go. Fast forward to the winter of 2018 when I decided I would like to be
able to start our Roomba away from home because of the noise it makes, and suddenly I had the project I was looking for.
Digging around I found out about
the <a href="https://www.irobotweb.com/%7E/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/iRobot_Roomba_600_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf">Roomba Open Interface</a>
and set out to start talking to my Roomba with <a href="https://circuitpython.org/">CircuitPython</a>.</p>
<h3 id="will-this-work">Will this work</h3>
<p>After reading through the Open Interface spec I decided it should be possible for me to control the Roomba by using the
Circuit Playground Express that I had waiting on the shelf. Getting the kit out and using the clips available I
connected the Playground Express TX to the Roomba RX, opened a REPL and tried to wake the Roomba, but received no
response.</p>
<p>After some more searching
I <a href="https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/18302/irobot-600-series-oi-wake-from-sleep-via-brc">found out</a> that
certain series firmware will not respond to wake commands after 5 minutes without a signal. Knowing this, and pressing
the power button once to wake the Roomba, I was able to START, STOP and DOCK the Roomba with controller code running on
the Playground Express.</p>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>After spending some more time confirming command structures, documentation and behavior between CircuitPython and the
Roomba Open Interface I decided to make things easier by building a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/circuitroomba/">package</a>
to abstract the interactions. With basic wiring and command functionality confirmed I decided it was time to start
looking at making remote signalling covered in part 2.</p>
