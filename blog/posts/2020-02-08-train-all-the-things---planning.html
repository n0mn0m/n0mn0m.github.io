        <p>Earlier this year Hackaday announced
the <a href="https://hackaday.io/contest/169421-train-all-the-things#j-discussions-title">Train all the Things</a> contest. I
immediately knew I wanted to submit something, but figuring out what to build took me a little bit. For my side projects
I like to make something that is useful to me, or somebody I know; while also learning something new. A few days after
the contest was announced my daughter was in the basement playing outside my office/homelab when I remembered my wife
had asked me if there was a way for her to know when I was working with somebody so that they could avoid coming down in
the basement. I thought a voice driven display could be a fun solution.</p>
<h3 id="choosing-tools">Choosing Tools</h3>
<p>After deciding on the project the next thing I wanted to figure out was what new boards I would need (if any) and how I
would build my model. After doing some research I landed
on <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers">Tensorflow</a> as my path forward for deploying a model to a
microcontroller. Having used Tensorflow the barrier for model creation is a bit lower, but I am really curious about
Tensorflow Lite and the potential it provides. Additionally a relatively new book <a href="https://tinymlbook.com/">TinyML</a>
looks like a good resource to use along the way.</p>
<p>After settling on TF Lite the next thing was picking a board. Most of my embedded experience has been with CircuitPython
and Rust. For this project I thought it would be fun to learn something new. The Espressif ESP-EYE caught my eye as an
interesting board known to work with TF Lite. I’ve seen the ESP32 and 8266 in a lot of other projects, so learning the
ESP toolchain seems valuable. Additionally a lot of the Espressif ecosystem seems to be built around FreeRTOS which
provides a whole other avenue of learning and hacking.</p>
<p>Finally I will need a way to let somebody know when the model has picked up voice activity, to signal that I’m currently
busy in the lab. The ESP32 has a WiFi chip providing the ability to send and receive signals via TCP if we want. The
ESP-EYE has that built in, and I happend to have a PyPortal (with an ESP32) that could make a great display checking for
a status using WiFi too. To signal from one to the other I decided to have some fun and use Cloudflare Workers K/V to
set a bit from the ESP-EYE that would be read by the PyPortal at a given time interval to set the display.</p>
<p>Putting it all together the initial idea looks something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/blog/07Ex2dh4NkgBHiLFg.jpg" /></p>
<p>Which allows me to have a small board in my homelab listening and the display above the stairwell where somebody can get
a status update before they ever come down.</p>
<p>The code, docs, images etc for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air">here</a> and I’ll be posting
updates as I continue along to <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/170228-on-air">HackadayIO</a> and this blog. If you have any
