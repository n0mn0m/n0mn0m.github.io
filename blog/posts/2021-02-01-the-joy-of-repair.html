        <p>A few weeks ago the Z Upper Right Assembly broke on my Mini 2. At first, I wasn’t quite sure what was wrong I only knew
that the tool head couldn’t raise on the right-hand side. In an email to Adrian (at Lulzbot) we figured out the part had
a hairline crack. In a year without covid I could have gone down to <a href="https://www.lvl1.org/">LVL1</a> to make a replacement
part, but not this year. Luckily Lulzbot was easy to get a print from, and really fast too (kudos to them, and that’s
nice to know for the future).</p>
<p>With this being my first repair I was a bit nervous. I had never taken my mini apart or tinkered too much instead opting
for that with my prints. The good news is Lulzbot has amazing <a href="https://ohai.lulzbot.com/">documentation</a> for each
printer that make repairs relatively straight forward. Beginning to end taking things apart and getting them back
together per the <a href="https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/z-axis-right-assembly-mini2/mini-2/">doc</a> took me an hour, and then
it was go time. My first print was <a href="https://www.lulzbot.com/content/meet-rocktopus">rocktopus</a> which came out great.
Seeing the right-hand axis work as expected was a huge relief, and gives me some confidence that I could do more for in
the realm of mods and repairs in the future.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? Because <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Manifesto">if you can’t fix it, you don’t own it</a>, and I was blown
away how easy it was to fix my Lulzbot. On top of that it was fun. Outside of gardening I don’t have the opportunity to
just fix stuff with my hands that much, and I miss that. Something to look into this year maybe?</p>
