This morning I sat down with some ideas that I planned to write about. Some of these were related to programming, others related to life. Regardless I noticed a barrier as I thought about how to communicate some of these notes. As I sat and thought about it I realized that I feel the need to write in a narrative format, when some (most?) of these items may be better suited as a short list of notes. So while many of my past post are in more of a long form or at least organized narrative structure in an effort to share some of what I feel like I continue to learn through my day to day experiences future post may take on new/different shapes sharing quick notes, but not trying to expand on them. If somebody is interested in expanded details they are always welcome to reach out.
