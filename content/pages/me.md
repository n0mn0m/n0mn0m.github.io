Hi, I'm Alexander.

For more than fifteen year I have had the fortune to work across a variety of
industrial domains collaborating with many inventive individuals. I have learned
a lot from these individuals introducing me to new ideas and philosophies, and
I enjoy every opportunity I get to collaborate with others.

Day to day I work on projects at the intersection of humans and computers. I
enjoy the challenge of making applications understandable while observing that
the technology and devices we use influence how we interpret the world around us.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with hardware, biking, swimming, cooking,
playing music with Maris, while making stories with family and friends.

If you want to chat you can send me an [email](%22mailto:alexander.hagerman@icloud.com%22),
or [patch](%22https://github.com/n0mn0m/%22).

My resume is available for [review](./resume.md), and I maintain a project list
[here](./portfolio.md).
