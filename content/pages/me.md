Hi, I'm Alexander

For more than a decade I have been fortunate to work across many domains with a lot of inventive individuals. I have
learned a lot from those who have spent time introducing me to new ideas and philosophies, and I enjoy every opportunity
I have to collaborate with others.

Day to day I work on projects at the intersection of humans and computers. I enjoy the challenge of making applications
understandable while seeing how the devices we use impact how we interpret the world around us.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with hardware, swimming, cooking, playing music with Maris, and story telling with
friends.

If you want to chat you can [message]("mailto:alexander@burningdaylight.io") me, or
a [patch]("https://github.com/n0mn0m/").

My resume is available for [review](programming/resume.md), and I maintain a project list [here](programming/portfolio.md).
