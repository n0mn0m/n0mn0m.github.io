I read a lot of books this year, but rarely write anything up after finishing them. While I don’t think I have enough to
say about any one book after my first read, I want to capture a sentence or two about them to look back on, and to share
with others. If I mention a book here that you want to talk about send me
a [message](mailto:alexander@burningdaylight.io).

### Q4 2020 List

**Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**

* I’ve been really interested in the idea of quality and how we achieve it in what we build. Everybody uses a different
  definition of “good”, and I enjoyed the exploration of the topic in this book.

**Blockchain Chicken Farm**

* Having grown up in rural kentucky and working in industrial chicken farming, then pivoting to writing software after
  high school this was a fantastic read. A lot to reflect on, the shared humanity, and the audacity of the software
  industry shined beginning to end.

**Subprime Attention Crisis**

* A good exploration of the dangers in the ad based internet economy. While the ad industry has made a lot of tools
  available to those who couldn’t afford them outright, I think we can do better than the current ad economy. While
  shrinking sectors can hurt, I think we need to be careful not to accidentally lead individuals to believe we need to
  maintain the ad economy at the invasive scale we are at today.

**Understanding Computation**

* As advertised. Computational theory using Ruby. I enjoyed the read and will probably revisit Part II sometime. It is a
  big book covering a wide range of topics and I don’t think I internalized Part II enough.

**The Hardware Hacker**

* A collection of articles from “bunnie” relaying his experience and some philosophies while manufacturing in the open.
  The term [shanzhai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanzhai) has popped up here and in other reading over the last few
  years.

**Angular Development with Typescript, Second Edition**

* What it sounds like. Reading this for work, and it was helpful as I got going with Angular.

**Programming Typescript**

* What it sounds like. A good read after going through the docs at typescriptlang.org.

**Vader Down**

* Vader being Vader. Fun short read.

**Shadowfall**

* This popped up as new at the library, and I was a few chapters in when I realized I had missed the first book in a
  series. So far I like it. It’s in the same vein as rogue squadron, and the author is working to write characters in a
  complicated environment. Curious to see how the series wraps up and if the character arcs land.
