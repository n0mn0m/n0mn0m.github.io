Recently Hackaday announced the results of
the [Connected World](https://hackaday.io/contest/163251-connected-world-contest) contest. It made my day when I read
Sophi’s email telling me that [ConnectedRoomba](https://hackaday.io/project/167025-connected-roomba) was one of the
OSHPark certificate recipients. What may have seemed like a small announcement meant a lot to me. I’m still fairly new
to this area of computing, and without formal training. Instead I spend a lot of time reading, listening and building to
learn everything I can. Validation and success no matter how big or small help us all stay motivated to continue in our
pursuits. Thank you to everybody at Hackaday for setting up a community and contest for us all to continue learning,
sharing and hacking together.

### Whats next

Everybody starts somewhere and the contest pushed me to get started on my first homebrew project. As part of this I
found a lot of new areas to study up on. I’ve enrolled in
the [edX Embedded Systems](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UTAustinX+UT.6.10x+3T2019/course/) course. If
you’re taking that too reach out as I’d love to have a group to work with. Additionally I want to migrate the ngrok
setup in my project to a route on my own domain, understand secure LoRa transmission and expand my electronics
knowledge.

On the board front I found [this](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/XuZmZmfd) interesting Feather PCB
from [@tannewt](https://github.com/tannewt) while debating what to do with the OSHPark certificate. I recently backed
the [FOMU](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/fomu) and learned of [FuPy](https://fupy.github.io/) so this seems
like an interesting PCB to pick up, order some components and start learning electronics at a whole new level.

Congrats to everybody that participated in the Connected World contest. Have fun hacking on whatever comes next! Thank
you Hackaday, DigiKey and OSHPark for kick starting this new learning path :).
