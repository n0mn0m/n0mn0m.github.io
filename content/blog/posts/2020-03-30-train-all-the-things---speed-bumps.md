As part of getting started on my project a couple months back I took a look at what boards were supported
by[Tensorflow lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers#supported_platforms) . Seeing an esp board I went
that route since I’ve heard alot from the maker/hacker community and thought it would be a good opportunity to learn
more. Additionally it’s been quite a while since I had a project that was primarily C/C++ so that was exciting. Like any
good project I ran into multiple unexpected bumps, bugs and issues. Some were minor, others were frustrating. I'm
capturing some of those here for anybody else that may be starting down the path of using Tensorflow Lite and an ESP32
board.

### Tensorflow speed bumps

Getting started with TF Lite is easy enough, but something I noticed as I continued to work on the project is just how
little things are designed specific to the platform. Instead the examples are setup with Arduino as a default, and then
work is done to make that run on X target. In the case of the ESP-EYE this looks like packing everything into an Arduino
compatible loop, and handling that in a single FreeRTOS task. I get the reason for this, but it's also a bit of a
headache later on as it feels like an anti pattern when addin in new task and event handlers.

Another bump you are likely to notice is that the TF Lite examples rely on functionality present in the TF 1.xbranch for
training, but require TF >= 2.2 for micro libs. Not the end of the world, but it means your going to manage multiple
environts. If managing this using venv/virtualenv keep in mind you're going to need the esp-idf requirements in the 2.x
environment, or just install in both as you may find yourself switching back and forth. In addition to python lib
versions the examples note esp-idf 4.0, but you will want to use >
=4.0with [this](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/pull/4251) commit or you will run into compiler failures. I ended
up using 4.1 eventually, but something to note.

Finally interaction with the model feels flaky. It’s an example so this kind of makes sense, but I found that while the
word detected was pretty accurate the newcommand and some of the attributes of the keyword being provided by the model
weren't matching my expectation/use. I ended up using the score value and monitoring the model to setup the conditionals
for responding to commands in my application.

Overall the examples are great to have, and walking you through the train, test and load cycle is really helpful. The
main thing I wish I had known was that the TF Arduino path for ESP was pretty much the same as the ESP native path with
regards to utility and functionality just using the esp-idf toolchain.

### ESP speed bumps

From the ESP side of things the core idf tooling is nice. I like how open it is and how much I can understand the
different pieces. This helped a few times when I ran into unexpected behavior. One thing to note is if you follow the
documented path of cloning esp-idf you will want to consider how you manage the release branch you use and when you
merge updates. Updates are not pushed into minor/bug fix branches instead they go into the release branch targeted on
merge.

Being new to the esp platform something I didn’t know when I got started was
that [esp-idf 4.x](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v4.0) released in February of 2020. Because of this
alot of the documentation and examples such as [ESP-WHO](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who)
and [esp-skainet](https://github.com/espressif/esp-skainet)are still based on 3.x which has a variety of differences and
changes in things like the TCP/network stack. Because of this checking the version used in various docs, examples etc
is (as usual) important. Since the TF examples reference version 4 that's where I started, but a lot of what's out there
is based on v3.

One other bump somebody may run into is struct initialization in a modern toolchain when calling the underlying esp C
libraries from C++. I spent some time digging around after transitioning the http request example into the TF C++
commandresponder code and the compiler told me I was missing uninitialized struct fields and their order made them
required.

The example code:

```javascript
esphttpclientconfigt config = {  
 .url = "http://httpbin.org/get",  
 .eventhandler = httpeventhandler,  
 .userdata = localresponsebuffer,  
};  
esphttpclienthandlet client = esphttpclientinit(&config);  
esperrt err = esphttpclientperform(client);
```

And how I had to do it in C++:

```cpluscplus
esphttpclientconfigt* config = (esphttpclientconfigt*)calloc(sizeof(esphttpclientconfigt), 1);  
config->url = URL;  
config->certpem = burningdaylightiorootcertpemstart;  
config->eventhandler = httpeventhandler;esphttpclienthandlet client = esphttpclientinit(config);  
esphttpclientsetmethod(client, HTTPMETHODPUT);  
esperrt err = esphttpclientperform(client);
```

I had a similar issue with wifi and you can see the
solution [here](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/voice-assistant/smalltalk/main/http/wifi.cc#L40).

I really enjoyed my lite trip into idf. It's an interesting set of components and followed a workflow that I use and
appreciate. I wrote a couple aliases that somebody might find useful:

```bash
alias adf="export ADFPATH=$HOME/projects/esp-adf"  
alias idf-refresh="rm -rf $HOME/projects/esp-idf && git clone --recursive git@github.com:espressif/esp-idf.git $HOME/projects/esp-idf && $HOME/projects/esp-idf/install.sh"  
alias idf=". $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh"  
alias idf3="pushd $HOME/projects/esp-idf && git checkout release/v3.3 && popd && . $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh"  
alias idf4x="pushd $HOME/projects/esp-idf && git checkout release/v4.0 && popd && . $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh"  
alias idf4="pushd $HOME/projects/esp-idf && git checkout release/v4.1 && popd && . $HOME/projects/esp-idf/export.sh"  
alias idf-test="idf.py --port /dev/cu.SLABUSBtoUART flash monitor"And I look forward to writing more about esp as I continue to use it in new projects.
```

Approaching the end of this project it’s been a larger undertaking than I expected, but I’ve learned a lot. It’s
definitely generated a few new project ideas. The code, docs, images etc for the project can be
found [here](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air) and I’ll be posting updates as I continue along
to [HackadayIO](https://hackaday.io/project/170228-on-air) and this blog. If you have any questions or ideas
