My first commit to on-air shows March 3, 2020. I know that the weeks leading up to that commit I spent some time reading
through the TF Lite documentation, playing with Cloudflare Workers K/V and getting my first setup of esp-idf squared
away. After that it was off to the races. I outlined my original goal in
the [planning](https://burningdaylight.io/posts/train-all-the-things-planning/) post. I didn't quite get to that goal.
The project currently doesn't have a VAD to handle the scenario where I forget to activate the display before starting a
call or hangout. Additionally I wasn't able to train a custom keyword as highlighted in
the [custom model](https://burningdaylight.io/posts/train-all-the-things-custom-model/) post. I was however able to get
a functional implementation of the concept. I am able to hang the display up, and then in my lab with the ESP-EYEplugged
in I can use the wake word visual followed by on/off to toggle the display status.

While it’s not quite what I had planned it’s a foundation. I’ve got a lot more tools and knowledge under my belt. Round
2 will probably involved [Skainet](https://github.com/espressif/esp-skainet) just due to the limitations in voice data
that’s readily available. Keep an eye out for a couple more post highlighting some bumps along the way and summary of
lessons learned.

The code, docs, images etc for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air) and I’ll be posting any
further updates to [HackadayIO](https://hackaday.io/project/170228-on-air). For anybody that might be interested in
building this the instructions below provide a brief outline. Updated versions will be hosted in
the [repo](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/docs). If you have any questions or ideas
reach [out](mailto:n0mn0m@burningdaylight.io).

**Required Hardware:**

1. [ESP-EYE](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-eye/overview)
2. Optional [ESP-EYE case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3586384)
3. [PyPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116)
4. Optional [PyPortal case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3469747)
5. Two 3.3v usb to outler adapters and two usb to usb mini cables

OR

1. Two 3.3v micro usb wall outlet chargers

Build Steps:

1. Clone the [on-air](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air) repo.

Cloudflare Worker:

1. Setup [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) DNS records for your domain and endpoint, or setup a
   new [domain](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) with Cloudflare if you don’t have one to resolve the
   endpoint.
2. Setup a [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) account with worker K/V.
3. Setup the [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler) CLI tool.
4. cd into the on-air/sighandler directory.
5. Update [toml](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/sighandler/wrangler.toml)
6. Run wrangler preview
7. wrangler publish
8. Update [Makefile](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/sighandler/Makefile) with your domain and test calling.

PyPortal:

1. Setup CircuitPython 5.x on the [PyPortal](https://circuitpython.org/board/pyportal/).
2. If you’re new to CircuitPython you
   should [read](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/circuitpython-essentials) this first.
3. Go to the directory where you cloned on-air.
4. cd into display.
5. Update [secrets.py`](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/display/secrets.py) with your wifi information and
   status URL endpoint.
6. Copy code.py, secrets.py and the bitmap files in screens/ to the root of the PyPortal.
7. The display is now good to go.

ESP-EYE:

1. Setup [esp-idf](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/) using the 4.1 release
   branch.
2. Install [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) and [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).
3. Setup a Python 3.7 virtual environment and install Tensorflow 1.15.
4. cd into on-air/voice-assistant/train
5. chmod +x orchestrate.sh and ./orchestrate.sh
6. Once training completes cd ../smalltalk
7. Activate the esp-idf tooling so that $IDFPATH is set correctly and all requirements are met.
8. idf.py menuconfig and set your wifi settings.
9. Update the URL
   in [toggle\status.cc](https://github.com/n0mn0m/on-air/tree/main/voice-assistant/smalltalk/main/http/togglestatus.cc)
10. This should match the host and endpoint you deployed the Cloudflare worker to above
11. idf.py build
12. idf.py --port \<device port\> flash monitor
13. You should see the device start, attach to WiFi and begin listening for the wake word “visual” followed by “on” or
    “off”.
