There is a lof of talk these days about building systems that don’t require trust. On paper this has some appealing
characteristics, and throughout history we have seen the issues that arise from unquestionable centralized authority,
but right now I think we are also seeing the impacts of missing trust in the analog (physical) realm.

As our physical and digital existence converge and the lines become blurrier I think it’s pertinent to keep in mind the
kind of systems and philosophies that we construct in each realm and how they can go on to influence the other.

I have a lot of thoughts and feelings on these subjects, and maybe I’ll go on to explore and write them down in the
future, but for now I just simply want to say that I don’t want to live in a world without trust.
