Last year I read the [“The Checklist Manifesto”](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) about the
outsized impact a checklist can have on an individual and teams.

I also started using [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) to keep a daily journal of what I'm working on, design notes,
todos etc. Having spent a few weeks with [org-journal](https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) I decided it was time to
create my own [templates](https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html). For my first template a checklist seemed
like an easy target. I made a few like PR Review, and New Service which can be found in
my [dotfiles](https://github.com/n0mn0m/dotfiles/tree/s/.emacs.d/org-templates) along with their bindings.

True to the goal, I’ve got a lot more consistent in my reviews and with capturing review artifacts. The service
checklist has been turned into a dotnet template that saves even more time.

Yay checklist!
