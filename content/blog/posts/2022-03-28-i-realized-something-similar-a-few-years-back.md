I realized something similar a few years back. Discovery is arguably easier than ever, but it's also super easy to fall
into just listening to what you know from established playlist.

I have found [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com) and some of their newsletters to be a good way to discover new artist and
songs.

A few artist from the last 10ish years that you might give a listen to:

- LEENALCHI
- Super Future
- Japanese Breakfast
- The Weekend

Have fun, there's a lot of good stuff out there!
