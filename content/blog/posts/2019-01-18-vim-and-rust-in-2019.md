I’ve been using Vim as my primary editor for a few months now. Recently I wanted to revisit some project work in Rust,
but I hadn’t setup any tooling in Vim for rust yet. The first couple of hits I got on Google were great resources that
I’ll provide links to, but they were also over a year old, so while using them as a starting point I’m documenting my
setup since some things have changed from 2017.

### Tooling

Core Installs:

* [Rust with rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* [Racer](https://github.com/racer-rust/racer)
  Autocomplete:

* [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
  Language Server Protocol

* [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp)
* [RLS — Rust Language Server](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls)
  So far this has been a fairly pain free experience. As I use this (and vim) more I will likely add some updates
  related to packaging, compiling and debugging in Vim, but for now these are the tools that got me started. One thing
  to note is that I recommend installing in the order above and following the install directions (especially for the
  lsp) since those appear to have made some QoL changes in the last year.
