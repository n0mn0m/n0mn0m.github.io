As part of setting up [tools](https://burningdaylight.io/posts/resharper-global-tools/) to run in our CI pipeline I also
setup a git pre-push[hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to run the same tools automatically
in the local context. Git provides a variety of hooks as documented in the scm book, and they can be used to reliably
automate different parts of your workflow.

*In addition to the official docs *[*this*](https://githooks.com/)* page has a nice summary*

### Code

The pre-push hook I built for our project looks like:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
PROJECTROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)  
echo "Running pre-push hook for${PROJECTROOT}"
dotnet restore $PROJECTROOTecho "Running resharper formatter"  
dotnet jb cleanupcode --verbosity=ERROR --config=$PROJECTROOT/.config/cleanup --settings=$PROJECTROOT/.editorconfig --no-buildin-settings $PROJECTROOT/AMS.sln
formatted=$(git status --porcelain=v1 2>/dev/null | wc -l)  

$formatted
echo "Running dotnet resharper inspector"  
dotnet jb inspectcode --verbosity=ERROR AMS.sln -p=$PROJECTROOT/.editorconfig -o=$PROJECTROOT/reports/resharperInspect.xmlpwsh $PROJECTROOT/tools/CheckResharperInspection.ps1  

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]  
then  
 echo "Running resharper dupe finder"  
else  
 echo "Inspector Errors Found"  
 exit $?  
fi

dotnet jb dupfinder --verbosity=ERROR AMS.sln -o=$PROJECTROOT/reports/resharperDupFinder.xmlpwsh $PROJECTROOT/tools/CheckDupeFinder.ps1  

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]  
then  
 echo "Running dotnet test"  
else  
 echo "Dupe Errors Found"  
 exit $?  
fi

dotnet cake --target=docker-bg  
dotnet cake --target=dotnet-test  

if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]  
then  
 dotnet cake --target=docker-down  
 echo "Go go go!"  
else  
 dotnet cake --target=docker-down  
 echo "Test failed"  
 exit 1  
fi
```

The first thing that should stand out is that this is just a shell script. Git hooks are just that, making it easy to
use shell, python, powershell or other tools with your hook. Write the script, link it to .git/hooks.

### Script Breakdown

In this script the first thing I do is find the root of our project. This makes it easy to reference paths in a manner
compatible with scripts and tools that are used throughout in other parts of our workflow.

### Install

Since the hook above is just a shell script I like to keep it (and other hooks) in a tools subdirectory in the root
project directory. Because git expects hooks to be under .git/hooks we can make it executable with a symlink.

```shell
ln -s -f ../../tools/pre-push.sh .git/hooks/pre-pushWith this in place we get feedback before each push so that we donâ€™t have to correct linting issues later, and we have can be confident our commit(s) will run through CI successfully.
```

### Wrapping Up

While you may have heard of projects like [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
or [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) rolling your own hook is relatively straight forward. While wrappers may
help with complex hook setups I personally like the low amount of indirection and abstraction that helps with debugging
when rolling your own.
