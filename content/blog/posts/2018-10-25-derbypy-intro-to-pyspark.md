This month at [DerbyPy](https://www.meetup.com/derbypy/) I provided a high level introduction to PySpark. For this talk
I went over the Spark execution model at a high level, talked about the difference between the PySpark Dataframe and RDD
api, and provided some examples of how to use both. As part of this I put together a jupyter notebook and some scripts
that can be used via spark-submit along with instructions on how to run PySpark locally.
