This morning I was setting up a RHEL 7 box for development using my normal dot files, but when I was ready to sit down
and start working on my project I noticed I got an error from You Complete Me letting me know that the version of vim
that was installed wasn't compatible. After checking EPEL for a more up to date install I decided to try pulling vim
from source and building it myself.

Luckily this wasn’t too hard, but I did run into a small issue related to the vim .config --with-python* flags since I'm
using conda as my Python environment manager. The short story is the vim needs some information from the Python config
directory to enable python and python3 support. When you use Anaconda or Minionda to manage your environments these are
in slightly different locations than the normal /usr or /lib64 paths you may find in vim build documentation. Instead
they will be in your conda environment lib as seen below.

Install additional build dependencies.

```bash
sudo yum install cmake gcc-c++ make ncurses-devel
```

Clone vim source, configure and build. Specifically pay attention to the — with-python* flags and the config directory
they use in your conda environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.gitpushd ~/vim/src./configure --with-features=huge \  
--enable-multibyte \  
--enable-rubyinterp=yes \  
--enable-pythoninterp=yes \  
--with-python-config-dir=/work/alex/miniconda3/envs/py27/lib/python2.7/config \  
--enable-python3interp=yes \  
--with-python3-config-dir=/work/alex/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x8664-linux-gnu \  
--enable-perlinterp=yes \  
--enable-luainterp=yes \  
--enable-cscope \  
--prefix=/home/alex/.local/vim | grep -i pythonmake && make installpopdFinally if you use a custom prefix as seen above (prevents system level changes and conflicts impacting others) you probably want to add the below to you .bashrc file.

if [ -d "$HOME/.local/vim/bin/" ] ; then  
 PATH="$HOME/.local/vim/bin/:$PATH"  
fi
```

And that’s it. You should now have an up to date vim install with Python.
