I read a lot of books throughout the year, but rarely write anything up after finishing them. While I don’t think I have
enough to say about any one book after my first read, I want to capture a sentence or two about them to look back on,
and to share with others. If I mention a book here that you want to talk about send me
a [message](mailto:alexander@burningdaylight.io).

### Q1 2021 List

* A Philosophy of Software Design — a good read that will impact how you think about writing your code. Many of these
  ideas have permeated out into general software culture (I think, maybe I’m in a bubble), but I would recommend this.
* Why we make things and why it matters — an interesting read on crafts and why we should embrace them.
* Humankind — good, but long at many points
* Kubernetes Getting Started — as advertised
* The Unix Administrators Handbook — I had a former manager recommend this book to me. I’ve read it through twice now
  and I always learn something new.
* Fluent Python 2nd Edition — A really good book on Python exploring areas that are not always tread, and Luciano does a
  great job of answering “why” as he goes.
* Django Crash Course — as advertised, a good alternative or secondary first Django tutorial.
* A Scoop of Django — A good read. I don’t feel like the answer of why is always explained to the level I would like.
  It’s hit and miss, sometimes it is, sometimes there is a link to a blog that I may get around to reading one day. A
  good book none the less.
* How to Invent Everything — probably my favorite book so far this year. This is a lot of fun and I look forward to
  reading it with my daughter one day.
* Think Julia — I’ve heard a bit about Julia and decided to check this out. A pretty good book revisiting a lot of
  programming first principles in the context of learning them with Julia.
* Math for Programmers — I really enjoyed this. I try to keep math as a regular reading topic, and I like it when math
  is demonstrated via programming.
